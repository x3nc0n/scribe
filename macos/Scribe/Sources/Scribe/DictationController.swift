/// or menu item that started it, its phase and what was captured when it started (the target application and
/// element, and the app profiles). Every start, stop, meter reading, fault and deadline names that id, so a late
/// event, a second stop or a stale deadline can never act on the recording that came after. Admission is decided when
/// the press arrives and checked again when the microphone is asked for, so a pause that lands in between wins. The
/// tray's test dictation stops on silence; a key tapped on and off (Caps Lock) does only when the user opted in
/// (`Configuration.toggleKeyStopsOnSilence`), and a held key never does. All stop at the duration ceiling, which is a
/// deadline of this controller's own (Windows' `ArmDurationLimit` and `TryAcceptDurationLimit`), since the capture
/// engine's own ceiling and silence clock only move while buffers arrive. A toggle whose recording ends any other way
/// than by its key (a failed open, silence, a fault) is settled, so the key's next change is not taken for its second
/// tap. Scribe never changes the lock state, so after such an ending Caps Lock's light is on with nothing recording;
/// since a recording starts only when the lock turns on, the next tap turns the light off and starts nothing, and the
/// tap after it starts the next recording.
///
/// **Stopping.** A stop can arrive in the event tap's callback, so it only retires the recording: the recording lets
/// go of the microphone, takes its place in both turn queues, and its samples are sealed on the capture engine's
/// control queue, off the main actor, while its processing waits for them.
///
/// **Processing.** A stopped recording is admitted to processing in the order recordings stopped, and a new recording
/// can start while earlier ones are processed. Each dictation runs raw speech recognition (one recognizer at a time)
/// and waits for startup's first rule load. With AI cleanup off it applies snippets, then the dictionary. With cleanup
/// on it decides every replacement on the raw transcript as cleanup off would, makes the vocabulary rules' in the text
/// it sends with the target's writing style (and a single-line instruction when the target flattens line breaks),
/// checks the reply against the text it sent and normalizes its dashes (`CleanupResponseGuard`), then makes the
/// snippets and the template-like replacements where the reply kept their words; a fallback is exactly the cleanup-off
/// result. It then formats line breaks for the captured target and delivers into that target only. Deliveries run in
/// dictation order, so a second dictation's text never goes in before the first's.
/// Cleanup never sees a snippet template or a template-like replacement, and no rule runs twice. Cancellation and
/// admission are checked again before cleanup, recovery and delivery, because the recognizer returns a transcript it
/// has already produced even when the cancellation arrives just after it exited.
///
/// **Presentation.** Every change to what the tray and the pill show takes the next revision (`DictationPresentation`).
/// Outcomes go through one schedule (`DictationNoticeSchedule`): a recording owns the pill, one notice shows at a time,
/// an outcome that cannot show yet waits rather than being lost or replacing a newer failure, and a notice's timed end
/// is tagged with the revision that showed it, so a stale end changes nothing.
///
/// **Shutdown** (`shutDown`): nothing new is admitted, the live recording is discarded, the pill and the tray go idle
/// under one last revision, every dictation in processing is cancelled, a delivery in progress is awaited to
/// completion (`TextInjector.waitUntilIdle`, which puts a borrowed pasteboard back), every cancelled dictation is
/// awaited (its recognizer's process group stopped and reaped by `ProcessRunner`), and the history writer is drained
/// within its bound, off the main actor.
