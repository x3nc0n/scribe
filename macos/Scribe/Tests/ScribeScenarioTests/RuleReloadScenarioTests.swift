/// What building the compiled rules costs with every built-in library switched on and twenty snippets, and what the
/// main actor pays to install them. The app compiles whenever the rules change, off the main actor
/// (`DictationRuleSnapshot.compile`, from `RuleSetRefresher`), and installs the result on it in one step
/// (`DictationRules.install`). The times are reported in the job summary, never asserted: runner speed varies too much
/// for a bound to mean anything. One dictation's rule work with all of those rules is reported beside them, with AI
/// cleanup off and on, and a model that changes nothing must still get exactly the cleanup-off text.
