// orders runs on the main actor: fakes hold their calls at gates the test opens, the clock moves only when the test
// moves it, and a test waits for an explicit signal (a gate's waiter, a controller checkpoint, a count) before it
// checks what did or did not happen, so no order depends on time. Time appears only as failure bounds: `waitUntil`
// gives up after a number of yields, `pollUntil` (for work on other threads, the capture engine's control queue)
// after a real deadline, and `bounded`, `within` and `HeldFlush` are watchdogs around waits a regression could strand.
// A harness settles every gate its test left open and shuts its controller down in the test's teardown.
