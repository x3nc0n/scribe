#!/usr/bin/env bash
# One-time setup for local macOS development: creates a stable, self-signed code-signing identity
# so rebuilt Scribe.app bundles keep a consistent signature across builds, and stores it in a
# dedicated keychain with a user-chosen password that can be reused later to unlock, delete, or
# recreate that keychain without regenerating the signing identity.
#
# Why this matters: macOS's TCC (privacy) database keys Accessibility/Microphone grants off the
# app's code signature, not its bundle path. build-app.sh previously ad-hoc signed ("codesign
# --sign -") on every build, which mints a brand-new signature each time, so a rebuilt app looks
# like a new binary to TCC and re-prompts for Accessibility on every single run, even after the
# user already granted it once. Running this script once, then re-granting Accessibility one more
# time for the resulting build, makes every subsequent rebuild keep the same signature and the
# same grant.
#
# Usage: scripts/setup-dev-signing.sh
